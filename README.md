Sus Meter

Sus Meter is a deterministic name-based “suspicion calculator.”
Enter a name and the system assigns a fixed percentage between 0 and 100.

The same name will always produce the same result. Fate is consistent.

Features

Deterministic hashing algorithm (same input = same output)

Animated conic-gradient meter

Light and dark mode toggle with local storage persistence

Shareable URL system using ?name=

Special name-triggered modes

Escalating “fate” mechanic when attempting rerolls

Hidden developer mode (not publicly accessible)

How It Works

The system uses a string hashing function to convert a name into a numeric value.
That value is reduced to a range of 0–100.

Because the algorithm is deterministic:

There is no true randomness

Rerolling does not change the outcome

Attempts to bypass fate are handled
